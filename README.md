# Planet Creator

This is a learning project aimed at creating a 3D world purely through code, without using any model files.
The project generates terrain using noise to simulate mountains and sea levels for planetary landscapes,
and shaders are used to create different biomes.

Special Thanks: Sebastian Lague,
for his tutorials that greatly helped me throughout this development process.
